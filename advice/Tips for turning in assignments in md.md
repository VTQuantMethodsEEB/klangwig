Tips for turning in assignments
================

-------------------------------------------------------------------
#### 1. Remember to update your README file

  Your README file should have:
  
  1) Your paragraph about your data at the top
  2)  A section for each week
  3)  In each weekly section, a description of what you did in each week
  4)  For each week, the names of the code and data files used that week
5) A description of what your column names mean, particularly if not obvious

#### 2. Make sure your code runs from beginning to end with no errors

#### 3. Make sure that if you change your datafile, your previous code still runs.

  For example, if in week 3 you change the name of your datafile, or the name of a column in your datafile, but your week2 code calls your old file, you need to update your old code, or leave an old version of your file that will work with week 2. 

#### 4. Remember to use relative paths, not exact paths. 

  For example, I will not have a directory on my computer that is Users/Smith/Desktop/classes/quantitativemethods/JohnSmith/dat.csv  - you should call mydat = read.csv("dat.csv"). 

#### 5. Annotate your code in script files

   Make sure to describe what you are doing in your code and why. 


#### 6. Make sure to pull from GitHub directory as soon you start working on your project. 

  This will incorporate any changes to previous scripts. For example, when you first open up your project, you should immediately pull from the GitHub repository. This will allow you to integrate any changes that have been made to your repository online (e.g. by me). 


#### 7. Avoid making changes to your GitHub repository via the web. 

  If you make a change to your repo using a web-based platform, and then also make a change on your computer, it will result in an inability to reconcile changes made in different places in you'll get error messages.
  

#### 8. Last resort tactics for git

  If you really can't fix your changes and google isn't helpful, you can always copy and paste your files to safe backup place on your computer. Delete your repository on the web and the folder on your computer, and make a new repository with the same name following the steps in Week 2. Copy your files back into your local repository and re-commit and push. This is not ideal, but should be used as a last resort. 


#### 9. Remember to type "Done - [githubrepo] name into Canvas

  For example, I would write - Done - klangwig. 


#### 10. Turn your assignments in on time. 

  Sometimes assignments are turned in late, and it is okay if I have confirmed this. However, at the end of the course, you get participation points which will be partly based on whether you turned in assignments on time (as well as answered questions in class, attended class, etc.).
