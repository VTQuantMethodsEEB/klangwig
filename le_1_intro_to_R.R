#selecting example
# InsectSprays is a built-in data set in R
class(InsectSprays)
names(InsectSprays)

#this gives the first 6 rows in the dataframe
head(InsectSprays)



# Select a subset of InsectSprays containing only the first list element
InsectSprays[1]
#this gives you just the count column

# Select the first row of InsectSprays
InsectSprays[1,]

# Select part of the first column of InsectSprays
InsectSprays[, 1]

# Select part of the first column of InsectSprays
InsectSprays[1:10, 1]


# Select the first row of InsectSprays
InsectSprays[1,]

# Select the fifth row of InsectSprays
InsectSprays[5,]

#in practicality, we often don't know where a particular element is in the dataframe
InsectSprays[InsectSprays$spray=="A",]
#this gives you all the values where spray is A
InsectSprays[InsectSprays$spray=="A"&InsectSprays$count<10,]
#there is only one value where insect spray is less than 10

#compare this with or which is the | symbol (that a straight line, not an I)
InsectSprays[InsectSprays$spray=="A" | InsectSprays$count<10,]
